Technologies used and architectural choices made:

- Javascript, HTML, CSS, and AJAX fetch API are the core technologies in use.
- I chose to include the student names, attendance percentage, guidance counselor, and home phone number, as these seem like the key pieces of information for putting an intervention in motion.
- I chose to use the fetch API as it is a quick and efficient way to get data from a local json file.  Javascript's filter function makes it easy to pull out the requested data according to the user define threshold.
